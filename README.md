# Airbnb Plus Certification
<p><b>Skills: Data Analysis, Data Visualization, R</b></p>

<p>The Airbnb Plus service, announced in February 2018, is one in which properties can pay a one-time fee of $149 to be considered for a Plus certification. The properties must have a minimum of 4.8 rating out of 5. The host must also have above a 90% response rate to guest questions, at least 80% of 5-star host reviews, and no cancellations in the last year. Additionally, properties have to undergo a 100-point quality inspection, rated on how well the property is designed, equipped, and maintained. Properties that successfully clear all of these criteria are listed with a Plus badge on the Airbnb site.</p>

<p>For consumers, does an Airbnb Plus badge provide assurance of a high-quality stay? A property owner may wonder if Airbnb Plus badge is worth it â€” does it result in higher booking rates, justifying investments in quality improvements and other costs of obtaining the certification?</p>
